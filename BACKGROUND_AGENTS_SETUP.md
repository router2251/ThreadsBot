### 🚀 How to Enable Background Agents in Cursor

#### Step 1: Turn Off Privacy Mode (CRITICAL)
1. Open Cursor Settings (`Ctrl/Cmd + ,`)
2. Go to **General** → **Privacy**
3. **Turn OFF Privacy Mode** (this is required for background agents)

#### Step 2: Enable Background Agents
1. In Cursor Settings, go to **Features** → **Beta Features**
2. Enable **Background Agents (Beta)**

#### Step 3: Connect GitHub
1. You'll be prompted to grant Cursor read-write access to your GitHub repository
2. When prompted, authorize the Cursor GitHub app
3. Make sure it has access to the `router2251/ThreadsBot` repository

#### Step 4: Verify Setup
1. Open the Background Agent Control Panel in Cursor
2. You should see your repository: `router2251/ThreadsBot`
3. Background agents should now be active and able to help with your code

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

#### If Background Agents Still Don't Work:

1. **Check Privacy Mode**: Ensure it's OFF in Cursor settings
2. **Verify GitHub Connection**: Make sure Cursor has read-write access to your repository
3. **Repository Visibility**: Ensure `router2251/ThreadsBot` is public
4. **Restart Cursor**: Close and reopen Cursor after making changes
5. **Check Repository URL**: Should be `https://github.com/router2251/ThreadsBot.git`

#### Common Issues:
- **"No remote access"**: Usually means Privacy Mode is still ON
- **Repository not found**: Check that the repository is public and accessible
- **Background agents not appearing**: Restart Cursor and check beta features are enabled
